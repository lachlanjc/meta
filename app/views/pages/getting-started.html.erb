        <p>Once you find an exciting product, you’re ready to dive in:</p>
        <p><strong>Developers:</strong> Pick out a code bounty, ask people how you can help, fork the repo, and start writing and committing code.</p>
        <p><strong>Designers:</strong> Find a design bounty, ask the team how you can help, download any design assets, and start creating mockups for new pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Anyone else:</strong> Whatever your skills may be, an Assembly team likely needs them. Introduce yourself and let people know what you'd like to work on.</p>
        <p>Also, you can always improve upon work that was done previously. Remember, the Assembly community values progress over consensus.</p>



        <h3>Collaboration</h3>

        <p>Products on Assembly are crowd-<strong><em>founded</em></strong>. Anyone can submit an idea, and anyone can join the team and get that product to market.</p>

        <p class="border-top gray-2 h6 py2 mt0 mb3">Meet a few of our many talented contributors.</p>

        <p>Assembly apps are built by everyone, and like successful open source products, each app also has a Core Team of contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app and the standards for quality, and determines which contributions are accepted. It consists of the most active and respected contributors on the app. The Core Team may comprise the original creator, Assembly staff members, and members of the community who help make the product a reality (that’s you!).</p>

        <p>Some people work on Assembly projects for just few hours a month. Some put in 40 hours a week. It’s up to you to work on what you want, when you want, where you want. The best part is that if you step away, the project keeps moving forward.</p>


        <h3>Ownership</h3>
        <p>The ownership of an Assembly product is distributed through App Coins. App Coins can be earned primarily by contributing to a product (design, code, copy, etc.). You can also receive “tips” in the form of App Coins when you provide insight, advice &ndash; or simply make someone laugh.</p>

        </div>


        <p>When an app launches and starts earning money, the profits are split each month among everyone who helped build it &ndash; based on the percentage of ownership each person has.</p>
        <p>While the emphasis is on collaborating to create apps with sustainable earnings over the long term, people also occasionally ask about acquisitions. The answer is, if a company offers to acquire an Assembly product and the product’s core team decides to accept the offer, that income would be distributed (after expenses are paid) based on App Coin ownership, just like any other revenue.</p>
